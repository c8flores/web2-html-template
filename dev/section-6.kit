                <p>New York Fashion Week has kicked off the autumn/winter 2020 season with plenty of colour, some injection of print and a fair few Instagrammable collections. From Candice Swanepoel in top-to-toe leather at Rag & Bone to Bella Hadid's abs at Brandon Maxwell and the boldest brights at Carolina Herrera and Oscar de la Renta, here are the catwalk moments you need to see from the Big Apple.</p>
